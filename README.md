1. When you will view the link, the Home page will open on your screen where you will be able to see the official home page of tesla but it is just a clone developed by me. The entire UI is almost similar to the official website. I have tried to make it so with my CSS Skills üöÄ

2. The home page has a single page and it is not scrollable as I have just made the first half portion of the page. But it is packed up with highend authentication functionalities of signing up and logging in. All of it has been done with the help of React Redux Toolkit and Firebase.
