# Tesla Clone build by Arka Lal - Steps to Know

In order to open and use my tesla clone build click on the link that is given under the about section of my github repository.

Advised to test the link in google chrome for better experience and you can also test it with the chrome dev tools.

The Web App is hosted freely on the cloud with the help of google firebase as it is just a project. This will help anyone to view my project publicly and test all of it's functionalities that i have developed.

# The Web App functionalities and How to use It?

1. When you will view the link, the Home page will open on your screen where you will be able to see the official home page of tesla but it is just a clone developed by me. The entire UI is almost similar to the official website. I have tried to make it so with my CSS Skills ðŸš€

2. The home page has a single page and it is not scrollable as I have just made the first half portion of the page. But it is packed up with highend authentication functionalities of signing up and logging it. All of it has been done with the help of React Redux Toolkit and Firebase.

3. Once you are in the home page now toggle the Tesla Account button on the right side and you will be redirected to the login page where you will have both the option of signing in or even signup if you not created and account.

4. Yes, you heard it right! You can actually create an account from scratch in my tesla clone side. As soon as you fill in the details and hit signup your account will be created as per the data given by you and you will be redirected to your tesla profile inside my web app.

5. All your input values will be automaticaly stored in my redux store with the help of the login action created by me with redux functionalities. And as per your input, data will be fetched from the redux store and will be displayed on your tesla profile along with the firebase authentication functionalities.
